IP Leak Detector is a cybersecurity utility SaaS. It performs a real-time forensic audit of a user's internet connection, revealing their exposed IP address, ISP, and physical coordinates on a map. It targets high-intent users concerned about digital privacy and links them directly to VPN solutions to encrypt their connection immediately.
